    description: [
      `I started my career as a Desktop Engineer in March 2014s which allowed me to operate on Windows and Unix platforms. In September 2014, I was involved in a large-scale, high-demanding software release as a QA tester of the very first online charging system in Japan that now has 10 million subscribers with NOKIA. This online charging software system, developed by REDKNEE India and Germany and NOKIA Japan, needed testing for meeting quality requirements and KDDI Japan carrier’s design requirements. To do the testing from the Nokia’s side, I learned the testing know-how from the development engineer and successfully implemented my tasks. During that hands-on experience, I became very familiar with the Unix operation, bash, and Windows server. I investigated the problems based on the log and analyzed the packet using Wireshark. I also learned testing procedures from the German and Indian test engineers through which experience I became a better communicator, able to discuss roadblocks and alternative solutions with my colleagues on the international team.
       In August 2015, when OCS went live, I was promoted to the role of Level 2 Customer Support Engineer. I was responsible for solving tickets from our customers in a timely manner. Being a Level 2 engineer in the environment where quality control standards were very high, taught me the best way to investigate customer problems, test and reproduce issues in the lab and apply fixed procedures on the online software which could potentially impact 10 million subscribers. I have experienced firsthand the commercial system upgrade and realized how a live system should operate, being extremely careful executing some of the commands. I was also involved in developing the upgrade procedure documentation for the commercial use and the on-site upgrades.`,
      `After learning a web development at Coder Academy, I started to work as Front-end Web developer using React.`,
      `I love my spare spend my time in the ocean and get salty. I love to play backgammon with frinds while drinking a mocha at cafe. I had a blast time in New Zealand and Australia (working holiday) where I could surf one of the best surf spot in the world. I also like the part that constatnly try to improve my surf skills. Surfing is hard so as Programming. I will never master everthing in my life time but that dones't stop me to keep improving.`,
